# Hi, I'm Floris

I'm a freelance developer working as **Quellabs**, specializing in PHP and JavaScript. I've spent nearly 20 years modernizing legacy systems and building tools that bring structure to unstructured codebases.

**Available for contract work** — particularly projects where the "just rewrite it" answer isn't realistic or desirable.

## What I Build

I maintain several open-source tools that reflect how I approach problems:

**[Canvas](https://github.com/quellabs/canvas)** - PHP framework for legacy integration. Lets you add modern architecture incrementally without torching your existing codebase.

**[ObjectQuel](https://github.com/quellabs/objectquel)** - ORM alternative using QUEL-inspired syntax. Data Mapper pattern, no magic methods, actually readable queries.

**[WakaPAC](https://github.com/quellabs/wakapac)** - JavaScript reactivity without the ceremony. Inspired by KnockoutJS, React and Vue.

## Philosophy

Most frameworks optimize for getting started quickly, then become obstacles. I build for what happens after month three:

- **Explicit over clever** - You shouldn't need to read framework source to understand your own code
- **Incremental modernization** - Legacy systems have value; replacement isn't always the answer
- **Rejection of magic** - If you can't trace how it works, you can't fix it when it breaks

## Quellabs Services

Through Quellabs, I take on projects involving:

- **Legacy modernization** - Adding structure to aging codebases without full rewrites
- **Custom tooling** - Building software specific to your problem domain
- **Architecture consulting** - Technical decision-making for long-term maintainability

If you're stuck with a system that works but can't grow, or need someone who won't immediately suggest starting over, let's talk.
