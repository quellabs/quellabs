# Hi, I'm Floris

Freelance fullstack developer specializing in PHP and JavaScript with ~20 years of experience. I build tools that make legacy codebases maintainable and modern development simpler.

## What I'm Building

**[Canvas](https://github.com/quellabs/canvas)** - A PHP framework designed to integrate with legacy applications, providing modern architecture without requiring a full rewrite.

**[ObjectQuel](https://github.com/quellabs/objectquel)** - A readable ORM alternative using entity-based queries inspired by QUEL. Built on the Data Mapper pattern for clean separation of concerns.

**[WakaPAC](https://github.com/quellabs/wakapac)** - A JavaScript reactivity library focused on simplicity and developer experience.

**[Discover](https://github.com/quellabs/discover)** - Automatic service provider discovery and organization across PHP applications and dependencies.

**[Sculpt](https://github.com/quellabs/sculpt)** - A command line toolkit that is used across the entire ecosystem

## Approach

I build for maintainability and clarity. Most frameworks add layers of abstraction that obscure what's actually happening. My tools aim to be:

- **Readable** - Code should explain itself
- **Practical** - Solving real problems over theoretical elegance  
- **Rejection of magic** - Everything is traceable
- **Legacy-friendly** - Modernization shouldn't require scorched earth

## Tech Stack

**Primary:** PHP, JavaScript  
**Focus areas:** Legacy modernization, ORM design, framework architecture, CLI tooling

## Working Together

I'm available for freelance work through **Quellabs**. Particularly interested in projects involving:
- Legacy codebase modernization
- Custom framework/tooling development
- Technical architecture consulting
